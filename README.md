# JINGLES-Music_Management_System
JINGLES music database website has a user side and an admin side, where a user can
easily see the available albums and play the music. Furthermore, the admin is crucial to the
management of this system. All of the primary tasks in this project must be completed by the
user from the admin side.

The user can view all of the most recent releases, the top 10 songs with rankings, news,
and highlighted music. They can also vote for and listen to their favorite songs. The customers
have the option to view every album and select any one to listen to its tracks.

The admin has total access to the system from the admin panel. Each music record can
be managed by him or her. The administrator must choose a genre, name, performer, writer,
description, and cover photo before adding albums. Admins have the ability to add album
genres. Additionally, he or she can just add songs to the album recordings that already exist.
